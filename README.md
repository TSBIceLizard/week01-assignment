## Some things I struggled with
I couldn't quite remember how to center items on the page in some cases. It seems that text is easy with text-align:center; but images and other elements are a different kettle of fish.

## Purpose of the website
The website's purpose was just to create a really basic portfolio template. If I was able to spend more time on it I could do alot more but right now am just trying to meet the assignment criteria instead of burning out!
